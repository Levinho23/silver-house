        <h3> Why is it better to buy in new buildings</h3>
        <p>With choosing the perfect place to call home, there are a variety of decisions to make. A major factor to consider is new build vs old house. But whether you want to invest in an older house or have a fresh start with a new build home, it's largely based on your own preference.
            Some people are immediately drawn to the charm and stability of an older house whilst others yearn for the blank canvas of a modern home. Then there are also some who have no idea where to start due to the endless amount of choices available to them.
            There are pros and cons for both house types so Compare My Move has compiled a list of some of the advantages and disadvantages of both new and older homes to help you decide exactly what you want. From the importance of hiring a chartered surveyor to issues you need to look out for in both kinds of property, we hope this guide will help make the choice easier for you when considering these.</p>
